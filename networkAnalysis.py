# "Randomized networks were obtained by swapping pairs of links chosen at random, avoiding multiple links and self-connections."
# 
# From the reference:
# 
# "A convenient numerical algorithm performing such randomization consists of Ô¨Årst randomly selecting a pair of directed edges A-B and C-D.  The two edges are then rewired in such a way that A becomes connected to D, while C to B. However, in case if one or both of these new links already exist in the network this step is aborted and a new pair of edges is selected. This last restriction prevents the appearance of multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes. A repeated application of the above rewiring step leads to a randomized version of the original network."
